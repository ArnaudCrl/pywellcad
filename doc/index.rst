pywellcad Documentation
=====================================

pywellcad is a Python library that provides an interface to `ALT <https://www.alt.lu/>`_'s
`WellCAD <https://www.alt.lu/products-wellcad/>`_ software using the automation module.

Currently it is just a thin wrapper around the COM API, but future plans will be to extend
the interface to be more Pythonic.
